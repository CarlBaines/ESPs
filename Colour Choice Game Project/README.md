For the CCG Game Project I needed to make a Python program that creates choices for both the player and the computer. The code also has to ask the player for inputs and compare them with the choice of the computer. The code then has to check if the game has been won, tied, lost or is still playing and these steps have to be continually implemented until the game has finished. As well as this, the code has to ask the user if they want to play again, through the use of an IF statement.
